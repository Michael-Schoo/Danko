## Assessment Instrument 3 - Website Project (Year 11 - Semester 1 - Web dev)

> You have been approached by the advertising company for DANKO (definitely not the ANKO company). They would like you to create a series of 5 mock web pages to advertise a product for them. They’ll need some analysis done for their product, example drafts of the webpages, and content filled mock ups as well.

## Part 1: Requirements Analysis & Design

To begin with, you’ll need to identify a product that you’ll want to advertise, and then do some analysis of the best ways to advertise that product. DANKO conveniently makes literally everything, so feel free to find any kind of product you'd like to advertise. To begin with, DANKO wants you to provide some initial documentation to detail your project. Specifically you'll need to:

1. Identify the product you'll be advertising, describe the target audience for it, and justify why they’re the target audience.
2. Develop a wireframe for at least 1 of your pages
    a. There are many tools for creating a wireframe, such as Wireframe.cc | The go-to wireframing tool.
3. Develop a sitemap that shows how all of your pages link together
    a. There are many tools for creating a sitemap, such as Flowchart Maker & Online Diagram Software

## Part 2: Development

Once you've developed your documentation you'll need to build some mock up pages for the website. You are to these pages using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to meet the following set of requirements:

1. Your website should contain at least 5 pages
2. Your website must combine **HTML** files with **external CSS** and **JS** files to produce a functional and aesthetic design/layout that meets the standards of the **W3C**.
3. The website must include **form elements** on multiple pages.
4. On one of the pages, you must include a form that acts as a ‘quiz’ - allowing the user to provide input and, when a button is pressed, compare the user input against a set of ‘correct’ answers and provide feedback to the user based on their result;
5. On one page you must have a text field that when filled out and submitted will update the webpage by inserting text into it.

The topic/content of the site can be determined by the author and does not need to meet any specific requirement except those outlined above. Although the site should contain appropriate information (either actual advertising material or lorem ipsum).
For this task the use of a CSS or JavaScript framework (such as Bootstrap or JQuery) is optional, but recommended.
A simple file structure that could be used as a basis for the website is shown here (but is optional and not required).

## Part 3: Evaluation

Once you have finished your website, you will need to write an evaluation that:
Compares your final product to your original sitemap and wireframe
Identifies and justifies any changes between them
Discusses how effectively the website meets the requirements outlined in the summary above.

## Submission Files

There are 3 major components to this assignment that you’ll need to submit:

* A planning document (in appropriate document format, .doc, .pdf, etc.)
* A website folder structure (in .zip format) (<-- this)
* A self evaluation
